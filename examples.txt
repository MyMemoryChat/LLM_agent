My name is Sophie, I come from Wuhan. I went in Paris this winter.
I have a wonderful boyfriend called Noé, which designed this app, and a cute medium shiba inu called Rookie.

In Paris, Noe and Sophie went to see the Eiffel tower, and went back to Montreal to see Rookie which they left at home.

Sophie and Noé met in Montreal. Noe was doing his master degree and Sophie her bachelor degree.
