-Goal- 
      Given a text input, extract entities and their relationships, return updated entities of the neo4j knowledge graph, and create new relationships between entities or update existing ones . You can create new, update and delete elements based on the chose action_type.

-Instructions-
    You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
    At the end of the loop you output an Answer
    Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
    Use Action, one at a time, to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
    Observation will be the result of running those actions and the planning of what comes next.
    Use End to quit the loop, and signal the end of the task.

    **Continue this Thought, Action, Observation loop until you have all the information about the persons, locations, and context related to the text.**

-Tools available-
    Your available actions are:

    {tools} 

-Steps-
    1. From a given text, identify all related entities.

    2. You enter a loop for each found entity:
        1. Search into the neo4j database using the tools you have and find the related entity as well as their relationships.
        2. If there is a corresponding entity in the database, update its description and its relationships from the input text. If no existing entity, create a new one and connect it with relationships. Knowledge entities and relationships are composed like this:

            action_type: One of the following type: [Created, Updated, Deleted]
            entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
            entity_type: One of the following types: [Person, Location, Event, Object, Pet] (Don't create new categories, if you don't know select object)
            entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities 
            Each entity is formatted as such ("entity"|<action_type>|<entity_name>|<entity_type>|<entity_description>)

            action_type: One of the following type: [Created, Updated, Deleted]
            source_entity: name of the source entity
            target_entity: name of the target entity
            relationship_description: detailed explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
            relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 and 100, indicating the strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity. Consider factors such as:
                How importand is the entities connection in the definition of an entity?
                How recent is this relation?
            Each entity is formatted as such ("relationship"|<action_type>|<source_entity>|<target_entity>|<relationship_description>|<relationship_strength>).
         3. Pass the formatted entities and relationships into the valid tool to update the neo4j knowledge graph. ** Important: Relationships can't reference non-existing entities. You have to double check your spelling or create new entities to avoid errors **

-Example session-

    Text: Person A met person B in a coffee shop at xx:xx in Y city.

    Thought: From the text, I can see 4 entities: A, B, coffee shop, Y with A connected to B, A and B connected to coffee shop and Y, and Y connected to coffee shop. I need the correct tool to see what the knowledge graph contains for them, and update it.
    Action: search_neo4j_graph A
    PAUSE

    (You will be called again with the output of the function.)
    User:
    ("entity"|A|Person|A is a turkish 26 years old woman.)
    ("entity"|A's mom|Person|The mom of A which lives in Ankara.)
    ("entity"|A's home|Location|The house of A in Istanbul.)

    ("relationship"|A|Istanbul|A lives in Istanbul.|90)
    ("relationship"|A|B|A is dating B.|80)
    ("relationship"|A|Cairo|A used to live in Cairo during her university studies.|40)
    ("relationship"|A|7 January 1999|The date of birth of A.|70)
    ("relationship"|A's mom|Ankara|A's mom lives in Ankara.|90)
    ("relationship"|A's home|Istanbul|A's home is in Istanbul.|90)

    Observation: I see that there is a corresponding entity A and that it is connected to B like in the text prompt.
    Thought: I don't have to update the entity A, since no new personal data was found in the text, but I can update its relationship with B and strengthen the relation because of the recent positive and important event.
    Action: update_neo4j_graph
    ("relationship"|A|Updated|B|A is dating B. They met in a coffee shop in Y at xx:xx.|85)
    PAUSE

    (You will be called again with the output of the function.)
    User: Successfully updated the knowledge graph

    (Repeats for every entity found at first. etc...)

    Thought: I have finished updating the knowledge graph from the passed information.
    End
